# Bryan Samuel James

**AI/ML Engineer · Data Engineering · MSCS @ Northeastern (Fall ’25)**

I build data‑to‑decisions pipelines end‑to‑end — from ingestion and modeling to eval and product UX. I care about reproducibility, readable code, and shipping useful tools.

## Quick links

* 🔗 GitHub: **@BryanSJamesDev**
* 💼 Open to: ML/AI research internships, data engineering roles, and TA/RA collaborations
* 📍 Boston, MA (relocating for grad school)

## Highlights

* 🧠 **RAG + Agents**: Built knowledge assistants and summarization utilities around vector search and rule‑based checks for conflict detection.
* 🏥 **Medical Imaging**: Worked on hybrid UNet/Transformer pipelines and FiLM conditioning for ultrasound classification/segmentation.
* 💹 **Data Engineering**: Designed Snowflake/AWS S3 pipelines, dbt models, and quality checks; focused on clean schemas and incremental loads.
* 🤝 **Team impact**: Documented decisions, added tests and CI, and wrote clear READMEs so projects survive hand‑offs.

> If you’re skimming: I’m strongest where **ML meets data systems** — building reliable ML features on well‑modeled data.

## Selected projects

### Online / Offline Retail Store (Java)

End‑to‑end retail prototype with inventory, sales reporting, and basic UI experimentation.

* Java + simple HTML view
* Emphasis on clear separation of concerns and testability
* Repo: `Online-Offline-Retail-Store-`

### Car Rentals (Python)

Menu‑driven car rental system focusing on clean object modeling (cars, customers, reservations) and CLI UX.

* Python
* Repo: `Rentals`

### Budget Tracker (Java)

Minimal, single‑file prototype for budgeting features; used as a kata to explore refactoring patterns.

* Java
* Repo: `BudgetTracker`

### CS50 AI — Degrees (BFS)

Graph search solution for “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.”

* Python
* Repo: `cs50ai-week0-degrees` (fork; customized walkthrough)

> More repos below — I’m gradually consolidating forks, adding docs, and pinning the most representative work.

## What I’m doing now

* 🎓 Starting **MSCS @ Northeastern University (Fall ’25)**
* 🔍 Exploring **multimodal summarization** and **RAG for domain knowledge**
* 🤗 Open to collaboration on **medical AI** and **financial data tooling**

---

## How I work

* Start with a **clean schema** and measurable success criteria
* Prefer **small, composable modules** over giant notebooks
* Add **tests + CI early**; automate data validation and model checks
* Write docs others can actually follow

## Let’s talk

If your team ships ML features and needs someone who can wrangle data, reason about models, and keep the repo healthy — I’d love to chat.

> Tip: Pin the projects above and add a few screenshots/GIFs for faster skimming by recruiters. I can help curate and tidy repo names/descriptions on request.

### Notes for future polish (todo)

* Add links to a portfolio site and a short resume PDF
* Include 2–3 project GIFs/screenshots
* Add badges (build passing, code style, license) to representative repos
* Create a /resources folder with blog posts, talk slides, and notebooks worth showcasing
